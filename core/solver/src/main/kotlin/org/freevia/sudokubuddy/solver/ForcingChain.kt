/**
 * Suppose a square held a digit, follow it through, and find the grid breaking.
 *
 * Every technique before this one recognises a *pattern*. This one does not: it takes a
 * candidate, assumes it, and pushes the consequences out across the grid until either
 * nothing more follows or some square is left with no digit it can hold. A square with no
 * digit is impossible, so the assumption was wrong and the candidate can go.
 *
 * That makes it the technique of last resort, and the one that gets a hard puzzle moving
 * when the pattern-based ones have all run dry. It is also the honest name for what
 * people actually do at that point, rather than pretending they spotted a swordfish.
 *
 * Deliberately bounded. Every candidate of every square could be tried, and the search
 * behind each is a full propagation, so this only looks at squares that are nearly
 * decided already and stops once it has found enough to be useful. Those are the ones a
 * person would try first anyway.

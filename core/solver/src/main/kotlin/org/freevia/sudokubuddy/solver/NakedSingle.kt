     * one, and the digits for which there is not.
     *
     * The evidence for a naked single is not the square itself. It is the squares around
     * it that have used the other digits up, and pointing at those is the entire lesson -
     * pointing at the square only says "look here", which the user can already see.
     *
     * [ruledOutEarlier] is the part this used to get wrong. The comment here read "there
     * is always exactly one such neighbour per digit: a candidate is only ever struck out
     * by a digit being placed where this square can see it", and that is true only until
     * some other technique has run. A pointing pair or an x-wing strikes candidates out
     * without placing anything, so a square can come down to one candidate with six
     * visible neighbours rather than eight - and the sentence "every other digit already
     * appears in this row, column or box" was then a plain untruth, in front of a
     * highlight that could not account for the missing two. Reported from the phone as
     * "why is it not a 1?", which was a fair question with no answer on the screen.

/**
 * One digit, coloured through its forced pairs until the colouring contradicts itself.
 *
 * Wherever a digit has exactly two homes left in a unit, one of them holds it and the
 * other does not - a see-saw. Link every such pair and the board breaks into chains, and
 * a chain can be painted in two colours so that one colour is entirely true and the other
 * entirely false. Which is which is unknown, and two things follow anyway:
 *
 * - if one colour turns up twice in the same unit, that colour is the false one, and the
 *   digit goes from every square wearing it;
 * - any square outside the chain that can see both colours cannot hold the digit, because
 *   one of the two colours is true wherever it appears.
 *
 * This is the first technique here that reasons about a whole board rather than a corner
 * of one, and it replaces a great many forcing chains with something a person can see.

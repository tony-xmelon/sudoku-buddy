 * up the digit in all N columns between them - so it cannot appear in those columns
 * anywhere else. The same holds with rows and columns swapped.

 * N = 2 is an X-wing, N = 3 a swordfish, N = 4 a jellyfish. Nothing changes but the size,
 * which is worth saying out loud: people learn them as three separate tricks and then

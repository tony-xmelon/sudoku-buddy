/**
 * N cells in one unit sharing exactly N candidates between them.

 * Those N digits have to fill those N cells in some order, so no other cell in the unit
 * can take any of them. Which cell gets which digit is not known and does not matter -
 * the elimination is what the technique is for.
 *
 * Reported one digit at a time: a naked pair usually clears two different digits out of
 * several cells, and "this pair rules 4 out of these three squares" is a step someone can
 * follow, where "this pair rules several things out of several squares" is not.

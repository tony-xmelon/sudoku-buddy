/**
 * Four squares in two rows, two columns and two boxes cannot all hold the same two digits.
 *
 * If they did, the two digits could be swapped diagonally and the grid would still be
 * legal - so the puzzle would have two answers. A properly set puzzle has one, so the
 * corner that has anything else left must use it.
 *
 * This is the only technique here that reasons about the puzzle rather than the position.
 * Every other one would still hold if the grid had a dozen answers; this one is an appeal
 * to the setter, and it is worth knowing which kind of argument you are making. The app
 * checks that a puzzle has exactly one answer before it offers any of this, so the appeal
 * is safe here - but on a grid someone has been filling in wrongly it would not be.

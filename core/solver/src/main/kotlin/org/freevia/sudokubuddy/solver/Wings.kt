/**
 * A pivot of two candidates and two pincers, which between them force a digit.
 *
 * The pivot holds {A,B}. One pincer sees it and holds {A,C}, the other sees it and holds
 * {B,C}. Whichever way the pivot falls, one of the pincers is forced to C - so any square
 * that can see both pincers cannot be C.
 *
 * The chain is only three cells long, which is what makes it the first technique that
 * feels like reasoning rather than bookkeeping.

/**
 * The fewest printed digits that have to be wrong, when a puzzle has no solution at all.
 *
 * "No solution" is a true statement and a useless one. Every puzzle in this app was read
 * off a photograph, so a puzzle that cannot be solved almost always means a digit was
 * misread rather than that the newspaper printed a broken puzzle - and the useful answer
 * is not "this cannot be solved" but "these two squares are the ones to look at".
 *
 * So: the smallest set of givens which, taken away, leaves a puzzle that can be solved.
 * Taking a digit away rather than changing it is the same question asked more cheaply -
 * if the rest of the grid has a solution without it, then that solution says what the
 * square should have held, so the cell can always be changed to something that works.
 *
 * Only givens are considered, because [Solver] solves from the givens and ignores what
 * the user has written, so nothing written can be what makes it unsolvable.

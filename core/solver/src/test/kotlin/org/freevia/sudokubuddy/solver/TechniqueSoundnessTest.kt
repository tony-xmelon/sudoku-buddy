/**
 * The one property every technique must have: it never removes the truth.
 *
 * A technique that places a wrong digit is caught immediately by anyone using the app. A
 * technique that *eliminates* a candidate it should not is far worse - it corrupts the
 * position quietly, and whatever the tutor teaches after that point is nonsense derived
 * from a lie. Twelve techniques are too many to eyeball, so this checks all of them
 * against a known solution at every state the solver passes through.

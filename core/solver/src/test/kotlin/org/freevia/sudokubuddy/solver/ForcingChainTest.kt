/**
 * A forcing chain is the one technique whose argument is a sequence rather than a
 * pattern, so it is the one that has to carry its working.
 *
 * These check the working, not merely that a trail came back: that replaying it really
 * does reach the wall it claims. A trail that does not lead where it says is worse than
 * no trail at all, because it teaches a step that does not follow.
 *
 * Taken from along the route rather than from the opening position. Nothing at all can be
 * deduced from the first position of this puzzle - that is what makes it the hardest one
 * in the set - so the chains only appear once other steps have opened it up.

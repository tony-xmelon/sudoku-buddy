         * The pages whose writing is the size of their print, and what that still costs.
         *
         * Everything downstream rests on finding the printed digits first, and that rested
         * entirely on size: the print is one population sharing a font, a colour and a
         * size, and the writing was always taller. On these ten it is not. Their
         * handwriting sits at 1.02 to 1.12 of the printed height where the print sits at
         * 0.98 to 1.01, so the printed band swallowed the answers and a finished page came
         * out claiming seventy-odd givens and no puzzle. It cost 220 cells of 729,
         * measured over the nine such pages there were at the time.
         *
         * It now costs 77. What separates them is ink - contrast against the paper of the
         * cell itself, times stroke width, both as fractions of the print's own - and it
         * is applied only to a page that has already shown the fault by finding more
         * printed digits than any sudoku has. Sorting every page that way costs printed
         * digits on pages where nothing was wrong, and lost three of them outright.
         *
         * What is left is 62 cells on twelve pages. The count is a ceiling rather than a
         * target, and it has moved for five different reasons, which is worth separating.
         *
         * It grew by pages joining: 94 on ten, 109 on eleven, 125 on twelve. Each time the
         * new cells were the new page's own and nothing that sorted correctly before
         * sorted wrongly after, so a page from this one reader costs fifteen or sixteen
         * cells here whatever else changes.
         *
         * It then fell from 125 to 100, and that was a fault of a different kind. Forty-
         * seven of those cells were not the print/handwriting collision at all: they were
         * answers thrown away as pencilled candidate marks for being smaller than the
         * print. See [GridReader.ANSWER_MIN]. What is left is the collision proper, and
         * it is a harder thing - measured, no rule over the six things the reader
         * measures does better than about seventy of these cells, where a small learned
         * function over the same six does thirty-three. Clustering has since taken most of
         * that ground without a model and without a threshold; what a learned function
         * might still add is unmeasured, and it would want corpus from a second hand.
         *
         * It then rose from 100 to 110, and that is the third reason and the least
         * obvious: a page that used to be refused outright now reads, so its cells are
         * counted here for the first time.
         *
         * And then fell from 110 to 77, which is the first time the collision itself has
         * given ground rather than the accounting changing. No new threshold: the two
         * populations are simply allowed to settle into the two clusters they lie in
         * instead of being cut apart by a bar. See [GridReader.settle].
         *
         * And from 77 to 62, when the size floor stopped being the only way into the
         * answer band: blur breaks a digit into pieces, and the biggest piece of a whole
         * digit can measure a third of one. See [GridReader.INKY_ENOUGH_ANYWAY]. Being unable to solve a puzzle is no longer
         * treated as being unable to read one, and blue-3 - whose printed digits do not
         * make one puzzle - comes back as a grid to be questioned rather than as nothing
         * at all. It brings ten of these cells with it. Nothing that was counted before
         * moved.

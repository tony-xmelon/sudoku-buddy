     * Pages whose handwriting is the size of the print, which the triage cannot sort.

     * Finding the printed digits first rested on their being the one population that
     * shares a font, a colour and a size. On these ten the reader wrote at the size of
     * the print, so the printed band swallowed the answers. Sorting them by ink as well
     * as by size has taken the cost from 220 cells to 77 over the twelve; the cause and
     * what is left are set out in [RecognitionAccuracyTest]. They are named here because
     * every test that walks the corpus meets them.
     *
     * They stay in the corpus. A page the reader cannot sort is the reason to keep it,
     * and their digits are still scored by the classifier, which is where they earn their
     * keep: the tally [RecognitionAccuracyTest] prints for them is measured on every run
     * rather than quoted here, because it moves whenever the model is retrained.
     *
     * All twelve came from the same reader, which is worth saying plainly: this is one
     * person's handwriting, not a law about newsprint. What it establishes is that the
     * size assumption fails for at least one real hand, which is enough.

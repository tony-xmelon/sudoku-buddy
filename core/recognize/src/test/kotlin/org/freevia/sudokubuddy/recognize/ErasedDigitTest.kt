 * Telling a rubbed-out digit from an answer, on numbers rather than on photographs.

 * The corpus measures this properly, but the corpus photographs are not committed, so on
 * CI those tests skip and this rule would travel unguarded. Every number below was
 * measured off a real cell, named in each case, so a change that breaks the rule fails
 * here rather than three weeks later on someone's phone.

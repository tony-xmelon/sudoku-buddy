/**
 * The shutter must never fire by itself on framing the gate is going to refuse.
 *
 * When the advisor was looser than the gate, the app auto-captured at between 15 and 18
 * degrees of corner deviation, and at any amount of perspective at all, then refused the
 * result. From the user's side that is the app taking a photograph of its own accord and
 * complaining about it - and it is the reason a straightforward page took a long time to
 * capture. These check the limits themselves, so no photograph is needed and CI runs them.

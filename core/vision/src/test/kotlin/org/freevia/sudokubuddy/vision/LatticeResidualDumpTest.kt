/**
 * How far each cell of a photograph sits from the flat grid that best explains all of them.
 *
 * "No single plane fits this page" is a conclusion drawn from one number - the mean
 * residual of the homography - and that number cannot tell a curled page from a few cells
 * whose contours broke. The two want completely different fixes, and the map tells them
 * apart where the average cannot: curvature is smooth, so the error grows across the grid
 * and reads as a slope, while a broken contour is a spike sitting among neighbours that
 * are fine.
 *
 * Measured on the newsprint set, one page runs 2 pixels to 44 in a clean gradient and the
 * others sit at 0 to 5 with three isolated spikes. That is what says the first is the sheet
 * of paper bending and the others are two or three cells measured badly.
 *
 * The map also shows, as dots, the lattice places no cell reached - a different fault
 * again, and the one that turned out to matter first. It is read off [CellGrid] itself
 * rather than worked out again here, because a diagnostic that reimplements the thing it
 * is diagnosing agrees with it right up until the day it matters.
 *

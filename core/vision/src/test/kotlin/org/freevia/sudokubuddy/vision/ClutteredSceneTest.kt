 * squarely in the middle of the frame. The candidate list was the ten largest contours,
 * and a patterned background supplies a dozen bigger than the puzzle - so the grid never
 * reached the list at all, however well it was framed.

 * The corpus is all clean surfaces, which is why nothing here was caught by it.

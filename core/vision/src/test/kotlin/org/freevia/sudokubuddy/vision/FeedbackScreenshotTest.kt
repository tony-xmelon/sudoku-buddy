/**
 * The screenshots sent back from the phone, run through the reader again.
 *
 * A screenshot of the camera is a photograph of the scene with some buttons drawn on it,
 * so the locator can be pointed straight at one. That makes every report of "it would not
 * scan this" into a case that can be re-run here for ever afterwards, which is the whole
 * value of keeping them.
 *
 * Local only, like the corpus: they are photographs of a real page. Skips on CI.
 *
 * The bar is deliberately low - a screenshot is a picture of a phone screen showing a
 * picture of a page, at a fraction of the resolution, so failing here is not damning. It
 * exists to stop a fix being claimed without the reported case ever being tried.

/**
 * Finds the grid by its cells, for when its border cannot be traced.
 *
 * Everything else in the locator starts from the grid's outline, and on newsprint the
 * outline is often not there to start from: the border is printed hard against the column
 * of text beside it, or against the black bar the paper runs down the edge of the puzzle,
 * and the threshold welds them into one shape that is neither square nor the grid. Two
 * corpus photographs failed in exactly that way, and on both of them the eighty-one cells
 * were perfectly clear - which is the point. A border can be lost to whatever is printed
 * next to it. The cells cannot, because they are holes inside it.
 *
 * So the cells are found instead - contours with a parent, of much the same size, packed
 * together - grouped so that a second puzzle on the same page becomes a second group, and
 * the grid's corners are solved from where the cells are rather than measured off an
 * outline.
 *
 * The solving is the part that matters, and it is not the obvious thing. Fitting four
 * corners to the outside of the cell cloud does not work: four extreme points are four
 * measurements, and one cell whose contour broke moves one of them and shears the whole
 * rectification. Measured on these photographs, every four-point fit tried - polygon
 * approximation, the smallest enclosing rectangle, the widest inscribed quadrilateral -
 * scored 0.00, and the straightened pictures they produced were plainly askew. Eighty-one
 * cells are eighty-one measurements of one projection, and the homography fitted to all of
 * them scores 0.54 and 0.48 on the two.
 *
 * One photograph needs more than a plane, because its page is not flat: no homography fits
 * its own cells, leaving them 13 pixels out on average and 48 at worst on a cell 72 pixels
 * across. That the page bends, rather than a few cells being measured badly, is not an
 * assumption - the map of how far each cell falls from the flat grid is an unbroken slope
 * from one corner of the grid to the other, and curvature is smooth where a broken contour
 * is a spike. So that page is straightened by a surface through its cells instead. See
 * [Lattice.flatten].
 *
 * Both halves were needed and neither was enough alone. The surface on its own reached
 * 0.46 against the 0.35 needed and still could not be read, because three of that page's
 * cells were being dropped by the place assignment and the corner they belonged to - the
 * corner where the sheet lifts - had nothing in it for the surface to follow. With the
 * cells kept, the same surface scores 0.73 and the page reads.

/**
 * Turning a camera frame into the picture the user is actually looking at.
 *
 * A phone hands its analysis frames over in sensor orientation and at the sensor's own
 * aspect ratio - landscape, four by three - while the viewfinder shows them turned
 * upright and cropped to fill a tall screen. Those are two different pictures of the same
 * scene, and judging one while the user aims the other is the whole problem: they line the
 * grid up inside the frame they can see, and the advisor is looking at a wider view where
 * the grid is smaller, off to one side, and surrounded by whatever else is on the table.
 *
 * These two operations put the frame back where the user thinks it is.

/**
 * Measures how much a rectified image looks like a 9x9 sudoku grid.
 *
 * The score is the weakest of the twenty places a grid line must appear, expressed as a
 * fraction of a typical line. A real grid has all twenty; a rectified sheet of paper has
 * the puzzle somewhere inside it and therefore misses several.
 *
 * Being the weakest of twenty is what makes it strict, and also what makes a single
 * obscured line - a thumb on a corner, a fold, a highlight across a screen - fatal to a
 * grid whose other nineteen are perfect. [obscuredAllowed] is how that is forgiven, and
 * it is deliberately not the default.
 *
 * Counting line peaks was tried first and does not work: a thick outer border splits
 * into two peaks and a column of digit strokes can align into a spurious one, so an
 * "exactly ten" rule rejected three of six good photographs. Asking whether a line is
 * present where one is *required* is insensitive to extras.

     * Two things had to change here, and the first is why a well-framed puzzle could sit
     * in the middle of the viewfinder and never be seen.
     *
     * The strength of a line is how far it stands above the page around it, not how much
     * ink it has: a column through a row of digits carries ink too. Measuring the rise
     * above the median column - which is a cell interior - is what separates a line from a
     * busy column of handwriting.
     *
     * And each line is judged against a typical line rather than against the strongest
     * one. The strongest is the outer border, drawn two or three times the width of the
     * inner lines, so dividing by it asks every thin line to be as inky as the thick one.
     * That bar rises as the grid gets smaller in the frame, until a perfectly framed
     * puzzle scores 0.3 for no reason except how far away it is.
     *
     * The absolute floor is what keeps the ratio honest. Comparing lines only with each
     * other, a blank square scores full marks - it has ten equally missing lines - which
     * is exactly what the framing advisor started reporting as a grid.

 * edge - is a remark about the framing and not a verdict on the photograph, and a remark
 * is no reason to throw away a puzzle that has been located and straightened. What comes
 * back is read as well as it can be, the complaint travels with it, and the person
 * looking at the screen decides whether the reading is good enough.
 *
 * That is a change of principle worth stating: the app cannot tell a photograph that will
 * read badly from one that will read fine - image metrics reject usable photographs and
 * pass unusable ones, which is why blur was never a rejection - so it should not pretend
 * to. It can tell whether it found a grid. That is the whole of what it now decides.
 *
 * The live advice in the viewfinder is untouched and still says all of these things while
 * the user is aiming, which is when they are worth saying. See [FramingAdvisor].

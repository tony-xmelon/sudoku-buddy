/**
 * Every way of reasoning this app knows, and how to spot each one.
 *
 * The same text the hints and the tutor quote, gathered in one place so it can be read on
 * purpose rather than only met in passing. Written to be read while holding a pencil: the
 * app can already finish any puzzle it can read, so the only reason to name a technique is
 * so the user can find the next one without it.
 *
 * Each one also offers to show every place it applies in the puzzle currently open, which
 * teaches far more than the paragraph above it does.

/**
 * How a saved puzzle is written down, separately from where it is written.
 *
 * Two blocks of nine rows - what was printed, then everything on the paper - which is the
 * same shape as the test corpus labels, so a saved puzzle can be dropped straight into
 * the recogniser's test data if it ever reads one wrongly.
 *
 * Split out of [History] because it is the one part of saving a puzzle that needs no
 * Android at all, and the one part where a mistake costs the user something: every
 * correction they have made to a grid goes through here and comes back out again. It sat
 * private inside a class that cannot be built without a Context, so nothing tested it.

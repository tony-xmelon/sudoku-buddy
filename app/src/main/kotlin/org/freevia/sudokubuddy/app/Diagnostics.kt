/**
 * Keeps the last few photographs the app took, so they can be sent to someone who can
 * look at them.
 *
 * Written because a scan failed on a phone in a way nothing here could reproduce: the same
 * scene, photographed and measured on a desktop, sailed through the very check that was
 * rejecting it. A screenshot cannot settle that - it is a picture of a screen showing a
 * cropped, re-encoded copy of the frame - and neither can a photograph taken with a
 * different camera app. Only the bytes this app itself handled can.
 *
 * Only refusals are kept here. A photograph that scanned is already saved as a puzzle,
 * and the straightened copy kept with it is exactly what the recogniser read - so it is
 * the more useful of the two when the digits come out wrong, and it is already in the
 * list where anyone would look for it.
 *
 * They live in the app's own external folder, which needs no permission, and go out
 * through a provider that grants read access to those files and nothing else - one at a
 * time from the list, or all of them at once with [shareAll] from the overflow menu,
 * which is where they are wanted the moment a scan has just failed. The app still has no
 * internet permission: sharing hands the files to whatever the user picks, and that app
 * does the sending.

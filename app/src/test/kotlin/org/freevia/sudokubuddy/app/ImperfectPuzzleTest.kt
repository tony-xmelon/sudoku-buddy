/**
 * What the puzzle screen does with a photograph that is not a proper puzzle.
 *
 * Until recently these never arrived: the reader refused anything it could not solve, so
 * the screen was only ever asked to show puzzles with exactly one answer. Now that a
 * reading is handed on whatever it makes, both other outcomes reach the screen, and Solve
 * has to have something to say about each. Silence is what made it look like a button that
 * did nothing.

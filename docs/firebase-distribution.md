# Distributing test builds through Firebase

Project: **`aisudoku-xmelon`** (number 52623658492)
The production package is now **`org.freevia.aisudoku`**. Register that package as a new
Android app in the existing Firebase project, replace the default app ID in
`app/build.gradle.kts`, and update the `FIREBASE_APP_ID` GitHub secret before the next
Firebase distribution. The previous Firebase registration belongs to
`io.github.tonyxmelon.aisudoku` and cannot receive builds with the new package name.

## What is already set up

- The Android app is registered in the Firebase project.
- A tester group `testers` exists. It is **empty**, so no build has emailed anybody.
- Two releases have been distributed successfully, so the path is proven working:
  `0.1.1 (1)` and `0.1.2 (2)`.
- The app id is committed in `app/build.gradle.kts`. It is not a secret - it is derivable
  from any built APK - so a fresh clone can distribute without configuration.
- CI builds a release APK on every push and uploads it as a workflow artifact.

`google-services.json` is deliberately **not** used. The app links no Firebase SDK and
makes no network calls; distribution is purely a build-time concern.

## Distributing from this machine

One command. It uses the locally signed-in Firebase CLI, so it needs no service account
and no token:

```bash
./gradlew :app:distributeLocal
```

Set `BUILD_NUMBER` to give the release a distinct version, e.g.
`BUILD_NUMBER=$(date +%s) ./gradlew :app:distributeLocal`.

## The one remaining step: distributing from CI

CI cannot use the signed-in CLI, because that credential lives only on this machine. It
needs one of two credentials, and CI accepts either. **Take the first one** - it is a
single command and never touches the Google Cloud console.

### Option A: a Firebase token (recommended)

```bash
firebase login:ci
```

It opens a browser, you sign in as **tony.xmelon@gmail.com**, and it prints a token.
Put it straight into GitHub without it landing in your shell history - this prompts for
the value and hides it as you paste:

```bash
gh secret set FIREBASE_TOKEN --repo tony-xmelon/aisudoku
```

Or add it by hand under `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository
secret`, named **`FIREBASE_TOKEN`**.

That is all. The next push to `main` distributes.

### Option B: a service account key

Only needed if you would rather not use a long-lived token.

If `aisudoku-xmelon` does not appear in the Google Cloud console, it is almost certainly
one of these, because a Firebase project *is* a Cloud project and this one demonstrably
exists (number 52623658492):

- **You are signed in as the wrong Google account.** The Firebase console link for this
  project uses `/u/2/`, meaning the third Google account in your browser. The Cloud
  console uses a separate index that does not always match, so name the account instead
  of guessing an index:
  https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=aisudoku-xmelon&authuser=tony.xmelon@gmail.com
- **That account has never accepted the Google Cloud Terms of Service.** Cloud hides every
  project until it has, including ones owned through Firebase. Opening the link above
  prompts for it.
- **The project picker is filtered by organization.** Firebase-created projects sit under
  *No organization*, which a Workspace account may hide by default. Clear the filter, or
  just use the direct link above, which bypasses the picker entirely.

Then: create a service account, grant it **Firebase App Distribution Admin**, create a
JSON key, and add the whole file as the GitHub secret **`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`**.

**Either credential is deliberately left to you.** Both can publish builds to your
testers, and neither should pass through anything but your own hands and GitHub's secret
store.

## Adding testers

The group is empty, which is why no build has notified anyone. Add people in
[App Distribution → Testers & Groups](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/aisudoku-xmelon/appdistribution),
or from the CLI:

```bash
firebase appdistribution:testers:add your.email@example.com --project aisudoku-xmelon
```

Adding a tester sends them an invitation email, which is why it has been left for you to do.

## Signing

Release builds are signed with the debug key. That is fine for App Distribution, where
testers install the APK directly, but it is **not** publishable to Google Play, which
requires a real upload key. When that time comes, add a keystore as further secrets and
point `signingConfigs` at it.

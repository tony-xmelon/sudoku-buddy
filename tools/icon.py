"""Draws the Sudoku Buddy launcher icon, raster and geometry.

The icon is the thing the app looks at: a printed sudoku on paper, zoomed until one box
fills the frame, with the ruled lines running off the edges because the grid carries on.
One cell is filled in the app's cyan - what it does to a square it has just read.

Three things are deliberate and easy to undo by accident:

  * **Digits, and a heavy box rule.** A bare three-by-three grid is noughts and crosses.
    What makes a grid read as sudoku is numbers in it and box rules heavier than cell
    rules. Both cost legibility, which is why the grid is one box rather than all nine -
    a whole nine-by-nine is unreadable mush below about seventy pixels.

  * **Paper, not ink.** A dark tile is stylish and says nothing. White paper with black
    rules says *printed puzzle*, which is what the camera is pointed at, and it holds up
    against a dark wallpaper and a light one.

  * **The corners are empty.** An adaptive icon is only guaranteed to show the middle
    circle of its 108 units, and the corner cells of a three-by-three sit exactly where a
    round mask bites. Nothing is put there that would be missed.

Geometry is in a 108-unit square so these numbers also serve the vector drawables in
app/src/main/res/drawable. The two must not drift apart.

"""Labels, and the bitmaps the Kotlin reader hands its classifier.

This used to carry a second implementation of the ink masking and MNIST-style
normalisation that CellAnalyzer does in Kotlin, on the reasoning that the thresholds
had to be measured against real photographs before being fixed in the app. Both were
then maintained by hand, and by 3 September 2026 they had drifted in four separate
ways at once - ink margin, resize filter, morphological anchor and blob connectivity
- so that not one cell out of 746 normalised to the same bitmap on both sides. The
model was trained on images the phone never produces.

So there is no longer a second implementation to keep in step. The Kotlin reader
exports the exact 28x28 bitmaps it feeds its classifier and training reads those,
which makes the two agree by construction rather than by vigilance:
